Solid principles on Typescript

#### 1. SRP - Single responsibility principle: 
A class should have only a single responsibility (changes only one part of the software specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)

#### 2. OCP - Open/closed principle
“Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”

#### 3. LCP Liskov substitution principle
“Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.”

### 4. ISP - Interface segregation principle
"Many specific interfaces are better than a general interface. It is better to use abstractions (interfaces, types or methods").

### 5. DIP - Dependency inversion principle
high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn't depend on details. The details should depend on abstractions (interfaces, types, methods).
