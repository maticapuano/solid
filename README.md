Solid principles on Typescript

#### 1. SRP - Single responsibility principle: 
A class should have only a single responsibility (changes only one part of the software specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)

#### 2. OCP - Open/closed principle
“Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.”
